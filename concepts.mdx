## Documentation Spaces and Structure

Spaces act as containers for your documentation. You create a space for each project or team, containing pages, folders, and sub-spaces. This structure mirrors your organization's hierarchy.

    A[Workspace] --> B[Space: Project Alpha]
    B --> C[Folder: API Docs]
    C --> D[Page: Endpoints]
    B --> E[Folder: Guides]
    A --> F[Space: Project Beta]
```

Use folders to group related pages and leverage page-level metadata for SEO and navigation.

## Permissions and Access Controls

You define permissions at the space, folder, or page level using roles like Viewer, Editor, and Admin. Assign users or groups to control who views, edits, or publishes content.
